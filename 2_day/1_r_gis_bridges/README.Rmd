# R as a GIS

Learning objectives:

- understand the advantages of running (open-source) GIS geoalgorithms from within R
- getting to know **rgrass7**, **RSAGA**, **RQGIS3**
- **RQGIS3** as one example of a bridge from R to GIS

To easily reproduce the examples shown during the tutorial, use the [**RQGIS3** docker image](https://github.com/jannes-m/docker-rqgis/tree/master/rqgis3_ltr).
