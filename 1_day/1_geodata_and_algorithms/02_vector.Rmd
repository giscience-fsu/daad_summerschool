# Simple features in R
Simple feature access is a widely used [ISO standard](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa). Edzer Pebesma implemented simple features in R via the **sf** package.
--

```{r}
library(sf)
```

**sf** automatically links to [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/), [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) and [PROJ](https://proj4.org/).

--
```{r}
data(random_points, package = "RQGIS")
class(random_points)
```
--

This is a **`data.frame`**, i.e, an S3 object (as opposed to `SpatialObjects`).

A few things to note:
- **sf** works with the **tidyverse**.
--

- Geometry is **just** another column.
--

- The geometry column is **sticky**.

---
Things to note continued:
- Each observation (row) has a geometry (which can consist of multiple features, think of polygons with holes or multi-part polygons).
--

- The geometry column is a so-called **list-column**.
--

- The geometry is build up of **simple** R structures.

Package sf puts features in sf tables deriving from data.frame or tbl_df, which have geometries in a list-column of class sfc, where each list element is a single feature’s geometry of class sfg. Feature geometries are represented in R by
- a numeric vector for a single point (POINT)
- a numeric matrix (each row a point) for a set of points (MULTIPOINT or LINESTRING)
- a list of matrices for a set of set of points (MULTIINESTRING, POLYGON)
- a list of lists of matrices (MULTIPOLYGON)
- a list of anything mentioned above (GEOMETRYCOLLECTION)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# creating an sf-object manually
library(sf)
p = st_point(c(1, 1))
p_2 = st_point(c(1, 2))
pts = list(p, p_2)
pts = st_sfc(pts, crs = 4326)
pts = st_sf(data.frame("id" = 1:2, "geometry" = pts))
# or using the "tidy" way
pts = list(p, p_2) %>%
  st_sfc(crs = 4326) %>%
  st_sf(data.frame("id" = 1:2), geometry = .)
```
---

# Putting it all together
**sf** uses three classes to represent simple features in R:

- `sf` is the `data.frame` with the attributes and the geometry list-column
--

- The geometry list column is of class `sfc`.

```{r} 
lc = random_points %>%
  st_geometry
class(lc)
```
--

- Each feature of the list column is of class `sfg`.

```{r}
class(lc[[1]])
```
--

# Attribute operations

---
# Attribute operations
- `sf` objects are basically dataframes and thus can be handled like any other R object.

--

```{r}
dim(random_points)
```
--

```{r} 
str(random_points)
```
---

# Subsetting

```{r}
# first 2 rows and first 2 columns
random_points[1:2, 1:2]
```
---

# Tidyverse
- When **dplyr** is also attached to the global environment, a number of generic methods of the tidyverse become available for `sf`-objects, most notably the one-table verbs `select`, `slice`, `filter`, `arrange`, `mutate`, `summarize` (and `group_by`).
--

- Piped operations are also supported (`%>%`).
--

```{r}
select(random_points, 1:2) %>%
  slice(1:2)
```

???
```{r}
m1 = attr(methods(class = "sf"), "info")$generic
library(tidyverse)
m2 = attr(methods(class = "sf"), "info")$generic
noquote(setdiff(m2, m1))
```

# Vector attribute operations

---

# Your turn
- Select all observations of `random_points` (`data("random_points, package = "RQGIS")`) which have more than 10 species (column `spri`). Plot the geometry of all points and add your selection to the plot in another color.
- Based on `spri` add a categorical column to `random_points`  with 0-5 corresponding to `low`, 5-10 to `medium` and >10 to `high`. 
- Optional: create two points of class `sfg` and convert them into an object of class `sf` which has an `id` and a `geometry` column.

# Spatial attribute operations

---

# Spatial attribute operations
Spatial operations make use of spatial relationship between objects (features). In the following we will address:
--

- Spatial subsetting
--

- Topological or neighborhood operations
--

- Spatial joins (spatial overlay)
---

# Spatial subsetting
.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# spData makes available
# nz and nz_height
library(spData)
plot(st_geometry(nz))
plot(st_geometry(nz_height),
     pch = 16, col = "red"
     cex = 2, add = TRUE)

```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# spData makes available nz and nz_height
library(spData)
par(mar = rep(0, 4))
plot(st_geometry(nz))
plot(st_geometry(nz_height), pch = 16, 
     col = "red", cex = 2, add = TRUE)

```
]

---

# Spatial subsetting
.pull-left[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
canterbury = nz %>%
  filter(Name == "Canterbury")
plot(st_geometry(canterbury))
plot(st_geometry(nz_height), 
     cex = 2, add = TRUE)
# spatial subsetting
sel = nz_height[canterbury, ]
plot(st_geometry(sel), cex = 2, 
     col = "red", pch = 16,
     add = TRUE)
````
]

--

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
par(mar = rep(0, 4))
canterbury = nz %>% filter(Name == "Canterbury")
plot(st_geometry(canterbury))
plot(st_geometry(nz_height), cex = 2, add = TRUE)
# spatial subsetting
sel = nz_height[canterbury, ]
plot(st_geometry(sel), cex = 2, pch = 16, col = "red", add = TRUE)
```
]

---

# Topological relations
Implicitly our subsetting used `st_intersects`, i.e. it returned all featured that touched or overlapped the `canterbury` polygon.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
nz_height[canterbury, op = st_intersects]
# see also
?st_sf
```
--

We can use `st_intersects` individually. This returns a boolean vector if there is an intersection.
--

```{r}
st_intersects(nz_height, canterbury, sparse = FALSE) %>% head
```
---

aside from `st_intersects` there are further predicates:
- `st_disjoint`: the opposite of `st_intersects`
- `st_touches`: just touching
- ... 
- have a look at `?st_intersects` for a complete list and description
???
```{r}
st_intersects(nz_height, nz)
```
This tells us that the first summit of nz_height has an intersection with polygon number 13 of nz.
And the same in matrix notation
```{r}
st_intersects(nz_height, nz, sparse = FALSE)[1:2, ]
```

---

# Spatial join
Transfer the attribute of one spatial object to another spatial object based on intersecting geometries.
For example, let us add the region name from `nz` to `nz_height` (so far consisting of columns `t50_fid`, `elevation` and `geometry`).
--

```{r}
join = st_join(nz_height, select(nz, Name))
```
--

```{r}
slice(join, 1:2)
```

# Your turn
- Filter the Canterbury region from `nz`, and find all summits of `nz_height` that do not intersect with the Canterbury region (both datasets come with the `spData` package).
- What happens if we spatially join the elevation column of `nz_height` to `nz`?

# CRS in sf
**sf** lets you use CRS and change CRS (reproject) through [PROJ]((https://proj4.org/).
--

```{r}
st_crs(4326)
```
---

# CRS in sf
Find out about a projection of a spatial object:
```{r}
st_crs(us_states)
```
--

Change the CRS with the help of `st_transform()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_transform(us_states, crs = 4326)
```

???
If one wants to know which position of the Earth we refer to, coordinates of geospatial data require a reference system:

    geodesic/geographic coordinates need an order (long/lat or lat/long?), a unit (rad, arc_degree?) and a datum (a reference ellipsoid: WGS84, ETRS89, NAD27?)
    cartesian/projected coordinates (e.g. UTM, web Mercator) need also measurement units, and some way of encoding how they relate to geodesic coordinates, in which datum (the Proj.4 string)

To handle coordinate reference systems, to convert coordinates (projections) and do datum transformations, Proj.4 is the code base most widely adopted, and actively maintained, by the open source geospatial community.

Package sf has crs objects that register coordinate reference systems:

# Your turn
- Create two overlapping circles (see below) and compute and plot their geometric intersection. Secondly union the circles.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pts = st_sfc(st_point(c(0, 1)), st_point(c(1, 1))) # create 2 points
# use the buffer function to create circles from points
circles = st_buffer(pts, dist = 1) 
x = circles[1]
y = circles[2]
```
- Compute the average population (`total_pop_15`) for each `REGION` of `us_states`. Plot your result.
- Find out about the CRS of `nz`, reproject it into a geographic CRS (EPSG: 4326) and plot the original `nz` object next to your transformed `nz` object.

# Recap
We have learned how to perform with `sf`-objects:

- Attribute operations
- Spatial attribute operations
- Geometric operations
