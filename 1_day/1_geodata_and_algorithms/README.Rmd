# Geodata and algorithms

Learning objectives:

- recapture how to define a GIS and why geographic data is special
- getting to know [Gecomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) as a resource
- the geographic vector data model in R and related most common spatial operations
- the geographic raster data model in R and related most common spatial operations

To easily reproduce the examples shown during the tutorial, use the [**RQGIS3** docker image](https://github.com/jannes-m/docker-rqgis/tree/master/rqgis3_ltr).
